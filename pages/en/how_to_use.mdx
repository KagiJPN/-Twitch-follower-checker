You can access the Twitch Follower Checker <Link class={"\_text-primary-600 \_underline \_decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]"}href="/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</Link>!

## Twitch Authentication

Upon your first visit, click the `Authenticate with Twitch` button to perform Twitch authentication.  
The list displayed will be based on the authenticated user.

## Follower List

A list of users currently following your channel is displayed.

## New followed List

A list of users who have started following your channel since the `Last checked` date is displayed.

## Unfollowed List

A list of users who have unfollowed your channel since the `Last checked` date is displayed.

## Differential Update

By pressing the `CHECK DONE` button, the date of `Last checked` will be updated. This affects the `New followed List` and `Unfollowed List`.

## Refreshing the Lists

Press the `REFRESH LISTS` button to retrieve the followers again and update the lists.  
Use this feature during a live stream or whenever you want to check the follower transitions in real time.  
Due to API limitations, there will be a few minutes delay before you can press the button again.

## User Filtering

You can perform user filtering and searching from the search box labeled `Search...`.  
All columns text such as the date when the user followed the channel and the display name are searchable.
